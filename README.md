# Let's Play Chess! üé©‚ôüÔ∏è

Welcome to my chess app where strategic geniuses and accidental prodigies collide in epic battles of wits! This is not just your ordinary chess app. It is a portal to both glory and unpredictable chaos! üöÄ

## What's the Deal?

This magnificent creation of mine (if I do say so myself) brings you the thrill of chess at [chess.micheleawada.com](https://chess.micheleawada.com). Brace yourself for an experience where you can challenge the AI, a formidable foe that swings between being an unparalleled genius or, well, let's just say... a *free spirit*.

### The AI: A Mythical Creature

Our AI opponent might just be the best you've ever encountered (occasionally, when it's feeling generous) or perhaps the worst in the history of computational mishaps (when it's having an off-day, which is often). Thats because it plays completely at random!

You'll find yourself immersed in intense battles against a bot that sometimes makes moves that even chess grandmasters wouldn't dare attempt. But hey, expect the unexpected and embrace the chaos! It might just surprise you.

## How to Contribute

If you're a chess enthusiast, a code wizard, or simply someone with a passion for making bots behave themselves, feel free to contribute! The AI is always up for a challenge, and we're open to improvements, whether they make it play like Deep Blue or more like your mischievous pet hamster.
